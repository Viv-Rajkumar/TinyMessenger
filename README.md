TinyMessenger
=====================================
A (Tiny)Messenger to allow classes to loosely subscribe and publish messages.
I have **not** made this project. This fork merely converts the original code to a PCL project and a few fixes to get it PCL ready.

## Sample

Sample usage is included with the solution showing usage of the `TinyMessenger` in different platforms with a PCL Core library.

## Additions to Original Code

 - Static `Default` property added to `TinyMessengerHub` for convenience like in MVVM Light.
